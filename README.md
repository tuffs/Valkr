Valkr is the web-first beautique programming shoppe in Destin, FL.
You will find that our approach to managing data, tasks, and users
at your business is different from most approaches.

Meaning that we aim to give your employees the ability to accomplish
their tasks in a proficient manner with the use of a web-browser and
complimentary software which works inside the web-browser.

Our guiding principle is that the employees that you hire are not
the most proficient users of new systems, legacy systems, or your
own file-storage systems. This means that you are losing time and
wasting money on educating your employees through training programs
that they inevitably hate and if we are being honest, so are you
and the rest of the c-suite and upper managemet.

Some know-it-all I.T. professional teaching us yet another system on
the phone or through a set of videos on YouTube and there is no real
help or training available to get people proficient at systems that
could possibly save your business time and money, could you and your
employees use the software properly.

Instead VALKR intends to write software that assists your employees
intuitively based on the systems that your specific office needs in
order to thrive and prosper in an ever evolving landscape.

VALKR typically works by being invited into your business to talk
with you and your employees, learn the ropes and identify weak
points and repititious work that is a total waste of time and we
also find the employees which could be replaced, and instead,
works to find ways to keep them employed by reskilling them by
providing a position better suited to their talents which aligns
with the systems we can create to solve I.T. and productivity
problems in the workplace.

We feel that in order to make businesses thrive and prosper we must
find inefficiencies, solve them and reposition your employees who
were not contributing to the success of the business and MAKE them
a contributing factor to the success of the businesses future.

We realize that we cannot rebuild your business from the ground and
do not intend to do so either. Instead, we want to provide systems
that can move the needle, increase happiness through the use of
systems which "just work" and are intuitive enough to allow people
to accomplish tasks that benefit your businesses day-to-day efforts.
